##Project 4
Flexbox and a map plugin was used to create a replica of an IU webpage. The goal was to create an exact copy.

##Project 3
This was a small project where we were assigned to partially redesign a local business company website. 
I chose to redesign the slurgemoore.com website that had used squarespace. I had found that their images were too large and I wanted to simplify the css styling to be cleaner. 
Only the home page and service page were made.

##Project 2
This is a static webpage showing the lyrics of eyes,nose,lips by Taeyang to explore css positioning and soem photoshop. 
Images are not as clear, because they were obtained from the google images. I would look at unsplash.com next time for better quality and free images.

##SEC (Spotless Exterior CLeaning)
This is a small project to aid a friend starting up his exterior cleaning company. This is still a work in progress with no deadline.
